## Synopsis

A simple program that sends an sms text to alert the user about the end of the day cryptocurrency values, and also alerts you if they go above/below a certain price. Uses Node.js, the Nexmo sms API and also pulls the market info from GDAX HTTP request.  


## Motivation

To sent my phone a text of a quick summary of how the markets did at a specific time, and to also be alerted if any of the specified markets fall above/below a specified threshold.

## Installation

A guide will be posted once I finish the threshold aspect of the project.


## Tests

Have node.js installed, and cd into src to run "node main.js"
